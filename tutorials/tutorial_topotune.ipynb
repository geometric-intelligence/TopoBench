    "In this tutorial, we go over the basic workings of [TopoTune](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06530), a comprehensive framework for easily defining and training new, general TDL models on any domain. These models, called Generalized Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks, are built using any (graph) neural network, which we will denote ω. \n",

    "In a GCCN (pictured below), the input complex--whether it be a hypergraph, cell complex, simplicial complex, or combinatorial complex--is represented as an ensemble of graphs (specifically, strictly augmented Hasse graphs), one per neighborhood of the complex. Each of these Hasse graphs is processed by a sub model GNN (ω), and the outputs are rank-wise aggregated in between layers. \n",
