class SheafTSPWrapper(AbstractWrapper):
    r"""Wrapper for the SheafTSP model.

    The SheafTSP backbone operates on 1-cell (edge) features using the
    Hodge Laplacians to derive sheaf connectivity.  This wrapper:
      1. Feeds x_1, down_laplacian_1, up_laplacian_1 to the backbone.
      2. Recovers 0-cell embeddings via incidence_1 (boundary map),
         preserving the encoded 0-cell features via a residual sum so
         node-level signal is not discarded.
      3. Exposes the backbone's sheaf Dirichlet energy (Eq. 15 of
         Tandon et al.) as ``model_out["sheaf_dirichlet"]`` during
         training, for the ``SheafDirichletLoss`` regularizer.

    This follows the same pattern as the CCCNWrapper.
