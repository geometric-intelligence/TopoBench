"""Sheaf Laplacian builder for *fixed*, externally supplied orthogonal maps.

Mirrors :class:`topobench.nn.backbones.graph.nsd_utils.laplacian_builders.NormConnectionLaplacianBuilder`
in formula but bypasses the lower-triangular-parameter → Cayley → orthogonal
pipeline. Conn-NSD computes its restriction maps deterministically (via
Algorithm 1 of Barbero et al., 2022) and they arrive at this builder
already in ``O(d)``; trying to re-route them through the Bodnar
parametrisation would be both wasteful and misleading about what the model
is doing.

The math is the *normalised* sheaf Laplacian of an ``O(d)``-bundle:

    Δ_F  =  D^{-1/2}  ( δ^⊤ δ )  D^{-1/2}

where ``δ`` is the coboundary acting on 0-cochains, the diagonal block
``D_{vv}`` equals ``deg(v) · I_d`` (every restriction map is orthogonal, so
``F^⊤ F = I`` and each edge contributes ``I`` to the diagonal accumulator),
and the off-diagonal block is the negative parallel transport supplied by
Algorithm 1 for that oriented edge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int
        Number of nodes ``N`` in the graph.
    edge_index : torch.Tensor, shape ``[2, E]``
        Directed edge index in PyG convention (bidirectional pairs expected).
    d : int
        Stalk dimension. Must equal the last two dims of the maps we receive
        in :meth:`forward`.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike a pair of independently learned endpoint restriction maps, the
    supplied matrices are already the edge transports produced by Algorithm
    1 of Barbero et al. They must therefore be inserted directly rather than
    composed with their reverse orientation.
